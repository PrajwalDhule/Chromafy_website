        <h2>Chromafy Documentation: Understanding the Extension's Features</h2>

<p>This page dives into the functionalities offered by Chromafy's intuitive interface, empowering you to effortlessly transform your website's color scheme.</p>

<h3>Color Palette Selection Boxes:</h3>

<p>
    Chromafy presents five color boxes arranged horizontally. These boxes represent the core colors of your website's palette:</p>

<p><span>Primary: </span> This color serves as the foundation of your scheme, often used for branding elements like logos and buttons.</p>
<p><span>Secondary: </span> This color complements the primary color and is frequently applied for accents and highlights.</p>
<p><span>Accent 1-3: </span> These colors provide additional options for creating visual interest and contrast within your website.</p>

<p>**Clicking on any color box** opens a color picker (discussed later) that allows you to choose a new color for that specific slot in your palette.
</p>
<p>
**Shortcut:** Pressing the corresponding number key (1-5) while a color box is focused might be an option for quick selection (implementation depends on technical feasibility).
</p>

<h3>Theme Button:</h3>

<p>
    The theme button, often represented by a house or palette icon, offers a convenient way to apply pre-designed color themes to your website. Clicking this button might reveal a dropdown menu or a separate dialog showcasing various theme options.

**Functionality:** Selecting a theme applies the pre-defined colors of that theme to your Chromafy palette boxes, allowing you to preview and potentially apply the entire theme to your website.

**Shortcut:** Assigning a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + T` or `Cmd + T`) to the theme button can be explored for quicker access (implementation depends on technical feasibility).
</p>

<!-- ### 3. Randomize (Generate Colors) Button:

Feeling uninspired? The randomize button, typically depicted by a shuffle or dice icon, injects a spark of creativity. Clicking this button generates a brand new set of random colors for your Chromafy palette.

**Functionality:** Each click on the randomize button creates a fresh color combination, allowing you to explore various options until you find a suitable scheme.

**Shortcut:** A keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Spacebar`) for the randomize button could be considered for a more interactive experience (implementation depends on technical feasibility).

### 4. Scheme Button:

The scheme button, sometimes represented by a gear or options icon, provides advanced control over your color palette generation. Clicking this button might open a modal or dropdown menu with options for customizing the color scheme generation process.

**Functionality:**  Depending on the implementation, the scheme button might offer options like:

* **Color Harmony Rules:**  Choose from pre-defined color harmony rules like triadic, analogous, or complementary to ensure visually pleasing color combinations.
* **Lightness/Darkness Adjustments:**  Fine-tune the overall lightness or darkness of the generated color palette.
* **Color Space Selection:**  Select the color space (e.g., HSL, RGB) used for color generation.

**Shortcut:** Assigning a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`) to the scheme button could be explored for ease of access (implementation depends on technical feasibility).

### 5. Undo and Redo Buttons:

These buttons, represented by arrows pointing left (undo) and right (redo), allow you to navigate through your color palette history.

* **Undo Button:** Clicking this button reverts your palette to the previous state, essentially taking back the last color change you made.
* **Redo Button:** Clicking this button after an undo action reverses the undo, bringing your palette back to the state before the undo.

**Shortcuts:** Standard keyboard shortcuts for undo (e.g., `Ctrl + Z` or `Cmd + Z`) and redo (e.g., `Ctrl + Y` or `Cmd + Y`) can be implemented for a familiar workflow.

### 6. Export Button:

The export button, often depicted by a download or outward arrow icon, allows you to save your meticulously crafted color palette for future use. Clicking this button might trigger a download or provide options for exporting the palette in different formats.

**Functionality:** The export functionality depends on the specific implementation. Chromafy could offer options to:

* **Download a CSS file:** This file would contain the color variables or class names representing your chosen palette, allowing easy integration into your website's code.
* **Copy to Clipboard:** The color values could be copied to your clipboard, enabling you to paste them directly into your website's stylesheet.

**Shortcut:** A keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + E` or `Cmd + E`) for the export button could be considered for a streamlined workflow (implementation depends on technical feasibility).

### 7. Close Button:

The close button, typically represented by an "X" icon, gracefully dismisses the Chromafy extension interface. Clicking this button hides -->
