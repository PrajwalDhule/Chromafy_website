    <h4>Data Collection:</h4>

      application data related to color palettes and themes. This data may
      include: Color Palettes: Colors chosen or generated by the user are stored
      locally for easy access and management. Themes: User-selected themes for
      the Chromafy extension itself can be stored for personalization across
      browsing sessions.

      Chromafy utilizes the stored data to: Pre-fill the color palette
      selection: When the user opens the Chromafy app, their most recently used
      or saved palettes can be loaded for quick access. Access previous color
      palettes: user can undo or redo palette generation to visit previously
      generated palette or next palette Maintain user preferences: Current theme
      (light or dark) can be retrieved from localStorage to provide a consistent
      experience.

      color palettes and theme preferences saved by the extension.

      localStorage API to protect user data. However, it's important to remember
      that no data transmission over the internet is guaranteed to be entirely
      secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee
